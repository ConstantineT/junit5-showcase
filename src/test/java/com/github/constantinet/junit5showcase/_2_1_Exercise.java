        Create two nested classes for testing of ComputationService divide method.
        They must contain positive and negative scenarios respectively.
        Positive scenarios must be parametrized with input parameters from a source of your choice.
        Assume that divisor is not zero in positive scenarios.
        In negative scenarios test if ArithmeticException is thrown in case of division by 0. */
